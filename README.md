Basic Python project to run PySpark on your IDE

Follow the provided steps to work with a local PySpark on your IDE (IntelliJ Idea or PyCharm).

# Required downloads and installations

## Anaconda

Anaconda is a complete Python distribution embarking automatically the most common packages, and allowing an easy installation of new packages.

Download and install Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

## PyCharm or IntelliJ Idea

IntelliJ Idea is a complete IDE with, between others, Java, Scala and Python pluggins. PyCharm is an equivalent IDE, but with Python as only pluggin (therefore lighter).

Download one of those two IDEs (community edition)
* PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
* IntelliJ Idea: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

If you choose IntelliJ Idea, you must install the Python pluggin, which is not incorporated by default.

* Choose a download type: Direct Download
* Click on the link in Step 4
* Once downloaded, unzip the file and place it in a directory of your choice
